            <strong>MINECRAFT</strong>
            <p>I developed Minecraft with the idea of creating an open world where players could build,
                explore, and survive freely. I used Java to program it from scratch, focusing on a simple
                but powerful block-based design that allowed for creative freedom. Over time, the game
                became a global phenomenon, used for both entertainment and education.

                <strong>ORACLE</strong><p>I developed Oracle as a global technology company specializing in database software, enterprise software, hardware, applications, and cloud infrastructure. Known for the world's first autonomous database, Oracle pioneered the development of database software and enterprise resource planning (ERP). More than 40 years later, Oracle is one of the largest software companies in the world, with a range of industry-recognized solutions addressing next-generation data management, engineering, and hybrid infrastructure. Through its broad portfolio of products and services, this enterprise provider serves more than 400,000 customers worldwide.</p>

                <strong>PERSONAL PROJECT</strong><P>I developed a web page with information about programming languages where online courses of such languages are also sold. I used this page as a resource for a university assignment, applying everything I learned in class. You can click the link and view the repository.</P>
